# Words Generator with LSTM on Keras

##### Wei-Ying Wang 6/13/2017

This is a simple LSTM model built with Keras. The purpose of this tutorial is to help you gain some solid understand LSTM model and the usage of Keras.

The code here wants to build [Karpathy's Character-Level Language Models](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086) with Keras. Karpathy posts the idea on his [blog](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). It is a very fun blog post, it generates shakespear's article, as well as Latext file with many math symbols. I guess we will never run out of papers this way...

Please head to [My Website](wayinone.github.io) for better description.
