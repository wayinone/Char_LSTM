It is a very fun blog post, which generated shakespear's article, as well as Latex file with many math symbols. I guess we will never run out of papers this way...

    "\n",
    "I check the keras code to derive the following statement.\n",
    "\n",
    " * First, when mentioning \"batch\", it always means the size of sample used in stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n",
    "\n",
    "    When build the first layer, if using `batch_input_shape` in `model.add(...)` and set the batch size to `10`, e.g.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    model.add(LSTM(m,batch_input_shape=(10,T,d)))\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Then when you doing `model.fit()`, you must assign `batch_size=10`, otherwise the program will give error message.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Consider this is a little bug, if you didn't assign `batch_size` in `model.fit()`, the SGD will run with default `batch_size=32`, which is not consistent with the `batch_input_shape[0]`. This is will raise `ValueError`\n",
    "\n",
    " * A better way is not to specify `batch_input_shape` when define the first layer; instead, using `input_shape=(T,d)`, which will equivalently assign \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    batch_input_shape=(None,T,d)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    And when you want to train the model, assign `batch_size` in `model.fit()`\n",

    "    This way one can input any number of samples in the model to get predictions, otherwise, if you use `batch_input_shape` then the input must be consistent to the shape.\n",

Then, in the next batch, the $h_0$ will be set as $h_T^\\star$  and the $s_0$ will be set as $s_T^\\star$. \n",
    "The previous procedure doesn't make a lot of sense. I just put it the way so you can understand. So, when will we use `stateful=True`? For example: when every time step you want to output a prediction (rather than output a prediction using 6 time steps, as we are doing here) We will, in the end, build that word generator that using previous word to generate the next word, at that time, we will turn this parameter on.\n",
